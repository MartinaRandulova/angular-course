      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).
    </p>
    <p>
      Prepare dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger,
      cinnamon, and cloves. Set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cream butter and sugar: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and
      fluffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add wet ingredients: Beat in the egg, and then add the molasses and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing well after
      each addition until a dough forms.

    </p>
    <p>
      Chill the dough: Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disc, wrap them in plastic wrap, and
      refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough makes it easier to handle and helps the cookies keep their
      shape during baking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll out the dough: Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C) again. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc
      of
      dough to about 1/4 inch thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cut out shapes: Use cookie cutters to cut out your desired shapes and transfer them to a parchment paper-lined
      baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. Keep a close eye on
      them, as baking times may vary depending on the size of your cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack
      to
      cool completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decorate: Once the cookies are completely cool, you can decorate them with icing, sprinkles, or other toppings
      as desired.
    </p>

      Enjoy your homemade gingerbread cookies!
